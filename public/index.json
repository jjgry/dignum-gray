There is some on-street parking on adjacent streets. Due to the limited parking, we\u0026rsquo;d ask that, when travelling on the day, you share cars wherever possible.\nBy public transport Train services to Chippenham and Swindon are frequent and reliable. Getting from those train stations to Cherhill is sadly neither. There are some local buses but those passing through Cherhill are very infrequent. It\u0026rsquo;s likely to be easier to arrange private transport i.e. taxi or lift sharing from a nearby town.\nHotels Accommodation options in Cherhill are limited mainly to holiday lets.\nWithin easy travel distance by car are a range of market towns including Marlborough, Devizes, and Calne. All offer a range of accommodation from Premier Inns to boutique hotels. Let us know if you\u0026rsquo;d like any specific information or guidance.\nThings to do in the area If you\u0026rsquo;re staying for more than the day, local attractions include:\nAvebury - A neolithic stone circle managed by the National Trust, Avebury offers a rich history, museum, and a good pub. There are a range of other neolithic and bronze age sites nearby such as West Kennet Long Barrow, The Sanctuary, Windmill Hill, and Silbury Hill. Marlborough - Market town with bustling high street and range of shops and pubs. We enjoy visiting Coffi Lab for coffee with our dog, and looking around the fruit and veg market on Saturday mornings. Devizes - Small market town with high street and range of shops and pubs. We often visit The Shambles Market on Sundays.
