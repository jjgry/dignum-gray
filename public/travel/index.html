By car
Travelling by car will provide the easiest access to Cherhill, with limited parking available at St James&rsquo; Church and Cherhill Village Hall. There is some on-street parking on adjacent streets. Due to the limited parking, we&rsquo;d ask that, when travelling on the day, you share cars wherever possible.
By public transport
Train services to Chippenham and Swindon are frequent and reliable. Getting from those train stations to Cherhill is sadly neither. There are some local buses but those passing through Cherhill are very infrequent. It&rsquo;s likely to be easier to arrange private transport i.e. taxi or lift sharing from a nearby town.">
